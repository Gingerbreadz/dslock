# dslock
Heavily inspired by this repo : [dslock](https://github.com/revan/dslock)

Designed to be more versatile ; the lockscreen image is generated with imagemagick only, enabling easy changes to the displayed message and its position.

Multimonitor is supported ; replicates the same lockscreen image among monitors, better support (such as independant message) coming in the future.  

## Usage
Download the dslock script, edit the top-file variables and bind the script to your lockscreen key combination.

## Dependencies
* bash
* imagemagick
* i3lock
